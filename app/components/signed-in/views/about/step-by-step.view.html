                Once you are signed up as a dealer you'll see a <i>plus</i> icon in the navigation bar. By clicking the icon you
                can upload a new product: add a photo of the product, tell us about it, choose a price, etc.

            </div>
            <p>
                Once you uploaded a new product, you can share it on Facebook with a rich media link, whether it's your
                private profile or business page. By clicking the link, your customers will be directed
                to the Dealers product page, where they are one step away from purchasing the product.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="margin-bottom-40">

            </div>
            <p>
                Now that you have rich media links directing your customers from Facebook to your Dealers product
                page, you can begin receiving orders online. You'll be notified by email with each new purchase.

                All the sales you made will be listed in your Dealers profile, under the <i>sales</i> tab. There you
                will see all the information regarding each purchase, including quantity, shipping address,
                and preferred shipping method.

            <p>
                All that is left to be done is to send your products. Go over each sale and send the right package
                according to the customer's requests. We recommend the following shipping companies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.zig-zag.co.il/" target="_blank">Zig-Zag</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.ratzcatzvi.co.il/" target="_blank">Ratz Catzvi</a> ("רץ כצבי")</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.israelpost.co.il/content.nsf/pages/messenger3?OpenDocument" target="_blank">Israel
                    Postal Company</a> (דואר ישראל)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After the product is sent, you can update the status of the purchase to notify the customer that the product
                is on its way.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="margin-bottom-40">

                At the end of each month, you receive the total income of all the <i>completed</i> sales you made. A sale
                is considered completed when one of the following occurs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The customer changed the status of the purchase to <i>Received</i></li>
                <li>Three weeks have passed since the purchase took place</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
