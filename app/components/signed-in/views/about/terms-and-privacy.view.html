    <h3>
        General Conditions
    </h3>
    <p>
        1.	We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Dealers account by disconnecting from the service in your profile settings or by writing to support@dealers-app.com with the Subject: Disconnect. If we terminate your access to the Service your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your deals and photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).
        <br /><br />2.	Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.
        <br /><br />3.	We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated Terms") from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.
        <br /><br />4.	We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.
        <br /><br />5.	We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.
        <br /><br />6.	We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.
        <br /><br />7.	You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Dealers is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Dealers reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.
        <br /><br />8.	There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Dealers does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Dealers is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Dealers has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the Dealers Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.

        <br /><br />10.

    <h3>
        Rights
    </h3>
    <p>
        1.	Dealers does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Dealers a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here below (bPrivacy Policyb).
        <br /><br />2.	Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Dealers may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.
        <br /><br />3.	You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.
        <br /><br />4.	You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.
        <br /><br />5.	The Service contains content owned or licensed by Dealers ("Dealers Content"). Dealers Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Dealers, Dealers owns and retains all rights in the Dealers Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Dealers Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Dealers Content.
        <br /><br />6.	The Dealers name and logo are trademarks of Dealers, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Dealers. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Dealers, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from Dealers.
        <br /><br />7.	Although it is Dealers's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Dealers reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Dealers, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Dealers encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Dealers is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Dealers will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.
        <br /><br />8.	You agree that Dealers is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Dealers does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.
        <br /><br />9.	Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at Privacy Policy below, as between you and Dealers, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Dealers is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Dealers in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Dealers, and Dealers will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.
        <br /><br />10.	It is Dealers's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Dealers does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Dealers is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.

        Arbitration
    </h3>
    <p>
        Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Dealers's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and Dealers (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Dealers, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Dealers hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Dealers will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Dealers is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Dealers or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.

        <br /><br />You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Dealers can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Dealers in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this email address with this subject to opt out:

        <br /><br />Dealers ATTN: Arbitration. Subject: Arbitration, contact@dealers-app.com.

        <br /><br />You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Dealers account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.

        <br /><br />If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Dealers.

    </p>
    <h3>
        Time Limitation on Claims
    </h3>
    <p>
        You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Dealers must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Governing Law & Venue
    </h3>
    <p>
        These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Dealers exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California , and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

        <br /><br />If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Dealers's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Dealers reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Dealers.

    </p>
    <h3>
        Entire Agreement
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Dealers and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Dealers. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Dealers. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Dealers will be null and void. Dealers may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
