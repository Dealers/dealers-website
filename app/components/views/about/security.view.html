                    Dealers is using Stripe for all the financial information and transactions. Stripe has been audited
                    by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to <a

                    industry. To accomplish this, they make
                    use of best-in-class security tools and practices to maintain a high level of security at Stripe.

                    Dealers is using the AWS – the Amazon Web Services cloud - for its backend services and databases.
                    AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that enables Amazon Web Services (AWS)
                    customers to manage users and user permissions in AWS. The service is targeted at organizations with
                    multiple users or systems in the cloud that use AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Database,
                    and the AWS Management Console. With IAM, Dealers centrally manage users, security credentials such
                    as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. All numbers and
                    other data are encrypted with the highest level of security in the industry. Amazon’s, as well as
                    Stripe's infrastructure, for storing, decrypting, and transmitting data, runs in separate hosting
                    infrastructure, and does not share any credentials with Dealers’ primary services (website, etc.).

                    When using Stripe on any transaction, they have keys to encrypt your communications with Stripe, or
                    verify signed messages you receive from Stripe. Which key you make use of is dependent on the
                    information needing to be transmitted:

                    <li>
                        To send sensitive data, such as credit card information as part of a data import, use
